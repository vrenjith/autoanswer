# 🎯 How to Use ScreenReader - For the Future

## 📚 **Quick Usage Guide**

### **🔧 First Time Setup (One-time only):**

1. **Click the ScreenReader extension icon** in Chrome toolbar
2. This will open a **configuration page**
3. **Get your free API key** from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
4. **Enter the API key** and click "Save"
5. **Test the connection** to make sure it works

### **📖 Daily Usage:**

Once configured, here's how to read any webpage:

1. **Go to any website** (news article, blog, documentation, etc.)
2. **Click the ScreenReader icon** in Chrome toolbar
3. A **floating popup appears** in the top-right corner of the webpage
4. **Type your question** about the page content
5. **Get AI-powered answers** instantly!

### **⌨️ Keyboard Shortcut:**
Press **`Ctrl+Shift+A`** on any webpage to open ScreenReader instantly!

### **💡 Example Questions:**
- "Summarize this article in 3 key points"
- "What is this page about?"
- "Extract the main facts from this content"
- "Explain this in simple terms"
- "What does this say about [topic]?"

## 🔄 **Two Different Interfaces:**

### **Configuration Page** (opens when not set up):
- Large full-page interface for initial setup
- Detailed instructions and help
- API key management and testing

### **Reading Interface** (appears on webpages):
- Small floating popup in top-right corner
- Quick access to ask questions about page content
- Draggable and non-intrusive

## 🚀 **Why Two Interfaces?**

1. **Setup once** - Use the full configuration page for initial setup
2. **Use everywhere** - Use the small popup for daily reading on any website

## ✅ **Ready to Use!**

After saving your API key, every time you click the ScreenReader icon on any webpage, you'll get the reading interface instead of the configuration screen.

**The extension is now working as intended!** 🎉
