# AutoAnswer Chrome Extension Icons

This directory contains the extension icons. For a production extension, you should replace these with proper PNG files:

- icon16.png - 16x16 pixels
- icon48.png - 48x48 pixels  
- icon128.png - 128x128 pixels

You can create these icons using any image editor. The icon should represent the AutoAnswer functionality - perhaps a question mark or AI symbol.

For now, you can use any PNG files with the correct dimensions, or create simple icons online using tools like:
- Canva
- GIMP
- Adobe Illustrator
- Online icon generators

The current manifest.json references these files, so make sure to add them before loading the extension in Chrome.
